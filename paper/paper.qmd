# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR, @opendatatoronto, and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....

# Data {#sec-data}

```{r}
#| label: fig-marriage
#| fig-cap: Marriage Licenses Issued
#| echo: false

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = marriage_licenses)) +
  geom_point()

```

We see marriages have seasonality in @fig-marriage as expected.
