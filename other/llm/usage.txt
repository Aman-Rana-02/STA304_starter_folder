Prompt:
  all_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/STA304/Term_Paper_1/paper/expenditure_analysis_data.csv")
  all_data$expenditure <- as.numeric(all_data$expenditure)
  
  # Expenditure by Year
  ggplot(all_data, aes(x = year, y = expenditure, fill = year)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Total Expenditure by Year", x = "Year", y = "Expenditure") +
    theme_minimal()
  
  # Aggregating expenditure by consultant and selecting the top 10


Response:
  Here's how you can complete the code for aggregating the expenditure by consultant and selecting the top 10 consultants based on total expenditure, and then plotting a bar chart for these consultants:
  
  ```r
  # Loading necessary libraries
  library(ggplot2)
  library(dplyr)
  
  # Reading the data
  all_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/STA304/Term_Paper_1/paper/expenditure_analysis_data.csv")
  all_data$expenditure <- as.numeric(all_data$expenditure)
  
  # Expenditure by Year
  ggplot(all_data, aes(x = year, y = expenditure, fill = year)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Total Expenditure by Year", x = "Year", y = "Expenditure") +
    theme_minimal()
  
  # Aggregating expenditure by consultant
  consultant_expenditure <- all_data %>%
    group_by(consultant) %>%
    summarise(total_expenditure = sum(expenditure, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    arrange(desc(total_expenditure)) %>%
    slice_max(order_by = total_expenditure, n = 10)
  
  # Plotting the top 10 consultants by total expenditure
  ggplot(consultant_expenditure, aes(x = reorder(consultant, -total_expenditure), y = total_expenditure, fill = consultant)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Top 10 Consultants by Total Expenditure", x = "Consultant", y = "Total Expenditure") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
  ```
  
  ### Explanation:
  1. **Aggregating by Consultant**:
     - We group the data by `consultant` and then sum up the `expenditure` for each consultant.
     - `slice_max` is used to select the top 10 consultants with the highest expenditure.
     
  2. **Plotting**:
     - The bar chart uses `reorder(consultant, -total_expenditure)` to order the consultants based on total expenditure in descending order.
     - The axis labels are rotated for better readability if consultant names are long.

Prompt:
  GIve me two plots, EY's share over time, by year. and Deloittes share over time by year

Response:
      To create two plots showing **EY's** and **Deloitte's** share of total expenditure over time (by year), you can filter the dataset to focus on these two consultants, calculate their expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure for each year, and then plot the results.
  
  Here’s the R code that achieves this:
  
  ```r
  # Filter data for EY and Deloitte
  filtered_consultants <- all_data %>%
    filter(consultants_name %in% c("EY", "Deloitte"))
  
  # Calculate total expenditure per year
  total_expenditure_per_year <- all_data %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarise(total_expenditure = sum(expenditure, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  # Calculate EY and Deloitte's share of expenditure per year
  consultant_share <- filtered_consultants %>%
    group_by(year, consultants_name) %>%
    summarise(consultant_expenditure = sum(expenditure, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    left_join(total_expenditure_per_year, by = "year") %>%
    mutate(share_percentage = consultant_expenditure / total_expenditure * 100)
  
  # Plot for EY's share over time
  ey_plot <- ggplot(consultant_share %>% filter(consultants_name == "EY"),
                    aes(x = year, y = share_percentage)) +
    geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
    geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2) +
    labs(title = "EY's Share of Total Expenditure Over Time",
         x = "Year", y = "Share of Expenditure (%)") +
    theme_minimal()
  
  # Plot for Deloitte's share over time
  deloitte_plot <- ggplot(consultant_share %>% filter(consultants_name == "Deloitte"),
                          aes(x = year, y = share_percentage)) +
    geom_line(color = "green", size = 1) +
    geom_point(color = "green", size = 2) +
    labs(title = "Deloitte's Share of Total Expenditure Over Time",
         x = "Year", y = "Share of Expenditure (%)") +
    theme_minimal()
  
  # Print the two plots
  print(ey_plot)
  print(deloitte_plot)
  ```
  
  ### Explanation:
  1. **Filtered Data**: We filter the dataset to include only "EY" and "Deloitte."
  2. **Total Expenditure per Year**: The total expenditure for each year is calculated across all consultants.
  3. **Consultant Share Calculation**: For both EY and Deloitte, we calculate their share of the total expenditure as a percentage for each year.
  4. **Line Plots**: Two line plots are created, one for EY and one for Deloitte, showing their share of expenditure over time.
  
  This will generate two plots: one for EY and another for Deloitte, showing how their share of total expenditure changes year by year.

  Prompt:
  Here is a sample of the table

{r}
#| label: data-head
#| fig-cap: Data Sample
#| echo: false

knitr::kable(head(all_data, 1), caption = "Data Sample", )


Response:
From the image you provided, it seems that the table formatting is problematic: the column headers are too wide for the table, causing the text to wrap awkwardly, and some elements appear misaligned. This can happen when a table contains long text or column names that don’t fit well within the PDF layout.

Here are several approaches to fix this:

### 1. **Use `kableExtra` to Add Line Breaks or Adjust Column Widths**
The `kableExtra` package can help you handle wide tables in a more structured manner, by either adding line breaks to long text or adjusting the width of columns.

#### Installation:
First, install the `kableExtra` package if you haven’t already:

```r
install.packages("kableExtra")
```

#### Modify the Table Code:
You can format the table and add options for handling the column width using `kableExtra`. Here’s how:

```r
#| label: data-head
#| fig-cap: Data Sample
#| echo: false

library(kableExtra)

knitr::kable(head(all_data, 1), "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Data Sample") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")
```

- **`kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")`**: This option will automatically scale the table down to fit within the page width in PDF output.
- **`booktabs = TRUE`**: Produces cleaner-looking tables with better vertical spacing.

### 2. **Manually Adjust Column Widths**
If some columns have very long text (like descriptions or names), you can manually adjust column widths by setting a specific width for those columns.

Here’s how you can do this using `column_spec` from `kableExtra`:

```r
#| label: data-head
#| fig-cap: Data Sample
#| echo: false

library(kableExtra)

knitr::kable(head(all_data, 1), "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Data Sample") %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "5em") %>%   # Adjust first column's width
  column_spec(2, width = "10em") %>%  # Adjust second column's width, etc.
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")
```

### 3. **Rotate Long Text Columns**
If some columns have very long names or content (e.g., "description_of_the_work"), you can rotate the column headers to save space:

```r
#| label: data-head
#| fig-cap: Data Sample
#| echo: false

library(kableExtra)

knitr::kable(head(all_data, 1), "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Data Sample") %>%
  column_spec(1, angle = 90) %>%  # Rotate text in first column
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")
```

### 4. **Wrap Text in Columns**
To avoid wrapping the text awkwardly across columns, you can wrap the text in cells using the `linebreak` function in `kableExtra`. This will ensure that long text is split into multiple lines, but within the same cell:

```r
#| label: data-head
#| fig-cap: Data Sample
#| echo: false

library(kableExtra)

knitr::kable(head(all_data, 1), "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Data Sample") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "10em") %>%  # Adjust column width
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")
```

### 5. **Reduce Text Size**
You can also reduce the font size to make the table fit better. To do this, use the `font_size` option:

```r
#| label: data-head
#| fig-cap: Data Sample
#| echo: false

library(kableExtra)

knitr::kable(head(all_data, 1), "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Data Sample") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down"), font_size = 7)
```

### Conclusion
These approaches should help improve the appearance of your table in the PDF. You can choose one or combine multiple techniques, like scaling down the table, adjusting column widths, and wrapping text, to get the best result. Let me know how it works or if you need further adjustments!
